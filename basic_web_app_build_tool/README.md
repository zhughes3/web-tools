# web-tools/basic_web_app_build_tool
Open your terminal.

Go to the directory where "create_web_app.sh" is.

Invoke it by typing the following command:

~~~~
./create_web_app.sh <NameOfProject>
~~~~

Now, if you type:

~~~~
ls -l
~~~~

You should be able to find the <NameOfProject> directory.

Inside, you will find a directory for css and js code along with an index.html file.

The CSS generated is a basic media query template.

Happy coding!
